# Ocean of Puzzles - Hardening Implementation Checklist

This document tracks the implementation of security, architecture, and workflow improvements based on the recommended hardening guide.

## âœ… Completed Implementations

### 1. Node.js Version Upgrade

- [x] Upgraded all Docker images from Node 18 to Node 22 (current LTS)
- [x] Updated all Dockerfiles to use `node:22-alpine`
- [x] Ensured compatibility with the latest package versions

### 2. Docker Container Security

- [x] Implemented multi-stage Docker builds for smaller, more secure images
- [x] Added non-root user configuration with proper permissions
- [x] Set read-only filesystems for production containers
- [x] Created security options to drop unnecessary capabilities
- [x] Added health checks for all services
- [x] Configured named volumes instead of bind mounts for better portability

### 3. Port Conflict Resolution

- [x] Created a domain-based approach with Traefik reverse proxy
- [x] Added automatic port conflict detection with `check-ports.js`
- [x] Implemented automatic port conflict resolution tool
- [x] Set up local domain routing through host file configuration
- [x] Created separate development and production Docker Compose files

### 4. Session & Cookie Security

- [x] Updated session cookie security to default to `secure: true`
- [x] Configured `sameSite: 'strict'` for production environments
- [x] Added proper CORS configuration for domain-based access
- [x] Enhanced session secret handling and validation

### 5. Networking & Routing

- [x] Added Traefik reverse proxy for HTTP/HTTPS routing
- [x] Configured internal Docker network with limited exposure
- [x] Set up HTTPS with automated certificate handling
- [x] Implemented domain-based routing for all services

### 6. Developer Experience

- [x] Created comprehensive developer setup script (`dev-setup.sh`)
- [x] Added local SSL certificate generation for HTTPS development
- [x] Implemented port conflict detection and resolution tools
- [x] Enhanced documentation with detailed setup instructions
- [x] Created workflow scripts for common development tasks

### 7. Database Scaling Path

- [x] Added configuration options for PostgreSQL in `.env.example`
- [x] Documented database scaling strategy in environment documentation
- [x] Created path for transitioning from SQLite to PostgreSQL

## ðŸ”„ Implementation Details

### Multi-Stage Docker Builds

Backend Dockerfile now uses multi-stage builds:
```dockerfile
FROM node:22-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
# Install dependencies and build app

FROM node:22-alpine
WORKDIR /app
# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && adduser -S -u 1001 -G nodejs node
# Copy only what's needed from builder
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
# Set user and run as non-root
USER node
# Health check configuration
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s CMD wget -qO- http://localhost:$PORT/health
```

### Traefik Reverse Proxy Configuration

Added Traefik service in `docker-compose.dev.yml`:
```yaml
traefik:
  image: traefik:v2.10
  command:
    - "--api.insecure=true"
    - "--providers.docker=true"
    - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
    - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
  ports:
    - "80:80"
    - "443:443"
  volumes:
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    - ./certs:/etc/traefik/certs
```

### Session Cookie Security

Updated session cookie configuration:
```javascript
cookie: {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: config.session.secureCookies,
  sameSite: config.isDevelopment ? 'lax' : 'strict',
  maxAge: config.session.maxAge
}
```

Changed security default to opt-out rather than opt-in:
```javascript
secureCookies: process.env.SECURE_COOKIES === 'false' ? false : true
```

### Developer Setup Automation

Created a comprehensive setup script that:
1. Checks for required dependencies
2. Sets up local domains in `/etc/hosts`
3. Generates self-signed certificates
4. Configures Docker environment
5. Starts the application with proper settings

### Port Conflict Management

Implemented a port checking tool that:
1. Detects if required ports are already in use
2. Identifies processes using those ports
3. Suggests available port alternatives
4. Provides commands to update configuration

## ðŸ“‹ Benefits Summary

These implementations provide several key benefits:

1. **Security**: Smaller attack surface, reduced privileges, proper cookie security
2. **Scalability**: Clear path from development to production, from SQLite to PostgreSQL
3. **Developer Experience**: Automated setup, port conflict resolution, domain-based access
4. **Maintenance**: Cleaner Docker images, better dependency management, up-to-date Node.js
5. **Performance**: Optimized containers with only necessary dependencies

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Complete PostgreSQL adapter implementation for database scaling
2. Set up monitoring and metrics collection
3. Implement CI pipeline for security scanning
4. Create backup and recovery procedures
5. Document production deployment process
