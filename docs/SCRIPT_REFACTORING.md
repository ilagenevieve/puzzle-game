# Development Script Refactoring

This document details the refactoring of the Ocean of Puzzles development scripts to improve efficiency, reliability, and developer experience.

## Overview of Changes

The development scripts have been refactored with the following goals:

1. Simplify the development workflow
2. Resolve port conflict issues automatically
3. Make scripts more robust and error-resistant
4. Improve cross-platform compatibility
5. Reduce code duplication
6. Maintain the ocean theme in a more streamlined way

## Key Improvements

### 1. Single Entry Point

- Created a unified `dev.sh` script as the main entry point
- Added subcommands for specific functionality (front, back, compose, etc.)
- Replaced the interactive menu with direct command-line options

### 2. Automatic Port Resolution

- Added dynamic port allocation with `DYNAMIC_PORTS=1`
- Implemented port availability checking before starting services
- Added detailed error messages for port conflicts

### 3. Better Error Handling

- Added prerequisite checking (Node.js, npm, Docker)
- Implemented proper signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Added detailed error messages and suggestions
- Used `set -Eeuo pipefail` for stricter error detection

### 4. Docker Awareness

- Added detection of Docker daemon status
- Implemented rootless Docker mode detection
- Added special handling for Docker Compose environments

### 5. Multiple Access Methods

- Created a `Makefile` for quick command access
- Updated npm scripts to use the new system
- Added backward compatibility for older scripts

### 6. Streamlined Ocean Theme

- Maintained ocean theming through emoji and colors
- Used `tput` for better terminal compatibility
- Simplified ASCII art while keeping ocean identity

## File Changes

### New Files

- `/dev.sh`: Primary development script with subcommands
- `/Makefile`: Simple shortcuts for common development tasks
- `/docs/dev-workflow/development-scripts.md`: Documentation for the new system

### Modified Files

- `/package.json`: Updated scripts to use the new system
- `/README.md`: Updated documentation to reflect the new workflow
- `/scripts/start-dev.sh`: Converted to compatibility redirect
- `/scripts/dev-with-logs.sh`: Converted to compatibility redirect

### Preserved Features

While streamlining the experience, we've maintained key features:

- Ocean-themed output with emoji and colors
- Log file generation
- Component health checking
- Ability to start individual components

## Usage Examples

### Basic Development

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
./dev.sh 

# Start with automatic port allocation
DYNAMIC_PORTS=1 ./dev.sh
```

### Component-Specific Development

```bash
# Start frontend only
./dev.sh front
# or
make front

# Start backend only
./dev.sh back
# or
make back
```

### Docker Development

```bash
# Start with Docker Compose
./dev.sh compose
# or
make compose
```

## Backward Compatibility

For users accustomed to the old workflow, compatibility scripts are provided:

- `npm run start:dev`: Still works, redirects to `./dev.sh`
- `npm run dev:logs`: Still works, redirects to `NODE_ENV=debug ./dev.sh`

## Benefits

1. **Efficiency**: Fewer keystrokes to start development
2. **Reliability**: Better error handling and detection
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple ways to invoke the same functionality
4. **Usability**: Clear help text and suggestions
5. **Maintainability**: Less duplicate code, more focused functionality
6. **Portability**: Better cross-platform support
