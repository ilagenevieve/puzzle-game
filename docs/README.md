## Documentation Principles

1. **Documentation in Parallel**: We update documentation alongside code development
2. **Single Source of Truth**: Each topic has one definitive location
3. **Versioning Strategy**: Documentation is tagged with code releases
4. **Ocean-Themed Styling**: Consistent ocean-inspired visual language

## Contributing to Documentation

- Use Markdown format for all documentation
- Follow the established style and organization
- Link between documents rather than duplicating content
- Include code examples, diagrams, and visuals when appropriate
- Document both "what" and "why" to provide context

## Getting Started

For new team members, start with the [Environment Setup](environment-setup.md) guide to get your development environment running, then explore the [Architecture](architecture.md) document to understand the system design.
