## Development Notes

The project follows the structure and technologies outlined in the specification document:

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express with a layered architecture (routes, controllers, services, models)
- **Frontend**: Svelte + Vite with component-based architecture
- **Database**: SQLite with direct query approach (no ORM)
- **Game Engine**: Phaser 3 (integration in progress)
- **Real-time Communication**: Will use Socket.io and PeerJS (connections established)

The codebase is set up with proper error handling, logging, and security practices, following the code style guidelines documented in `docs/dev-workflow/style-guide.md`.

## To Run the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/puzzle-game.git
cd puzzle-game

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with appropriate values

# Start development environment with Docker (recommended)
docker-compose up --build

# Alternatively, you can run the frontend and backend separately
# Frontend:
cd frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev

# Backend:
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then access:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:4000/api/v1

### Game Engine Demo
To test the game engine and play the Nim game:
1. Navigate to `/game-demo` in your browser
2. You'll see two options: Physics Demo and Nim Game
3. Physics Demo shows interactive particle effects and physics simulation
4. Nim Game lets you play against an AI opponent

The game engine components are located in `/frontend/src/game/` and include:
- `PhaserContainer.svelte`: Svelte wrapper for Phaser
- `GameCanvas.svelte`: Responsive canvas container
- `GameManager.js`: Central game management
- `scenes/`: Game scenes including TestScene and NimGame
- `board/`: Board game engine with Nim implementation

## Testing the API

In development mode, an admin user is automatically created with:
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123

You can use this account to test the authentication endpoints:

```bash
# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin123"}' \
  -c cookies.txt

# Get current user
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/v1/users/me \
  -b cookies.txt

# Logout
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/v1/auth/logout \
  -b cookies.txt
```
